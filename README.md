# One-Time-Pad
Python GUI chat that attempts to use os.urandom() and Diffie Hellman secret sharing to communicate securely

Created during Spring 2022 for CSDS 356 Data Privacy at CWRU.  The project was to test the randomness of numbers from a cryptographically secure pseudo random number geneator (CSPRNG) vs the numbers from a simulated Qiskit quantum random number generator (QRNG).

Additional Notes
Diffie Hellman Secret Sharing is defeatable by man in the middle (MITM) attacks, so this project is probably not secure
